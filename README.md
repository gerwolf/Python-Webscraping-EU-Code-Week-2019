# Python-Webscraping-EU Code Week 2019
 This is the rep for the Jupyter notebooks we developed in our coding workshop.
 We covered a lot of Python concepts, syntax, logic, data types and learned how to scrape any (public) website, identify relevant elements and structure them in a convenient file format. 
 We connected to the Twitter API and retrieved data such as a likes, date and Tweet-ID. We used the pandas-datareader API to load data directly into our Jupyter notebook and visualise it.
 Finally, we applied our newly learned skills to a full project, a Spotify scraper, covering different scraping techniques and API communication to access additional data features that aren't readily available. We accessed the streaming charts for the past three years on a daily basis by track (guess which one is the most streamed song in Germany?) and identified strong predictors for popularity of individual songs on Spotify by linear regression.
 I didn't have time to cover Selenium but I've also provided a notebook that shows you the basics for this powerful tool.

 Enjoy and happy coding!
